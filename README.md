# api-design-nodejs-v4

API Design is done for [Chronos App](https://www.framer.com/templates/chronos/), a changelog application which displays product updates in timeline format, for tracking product's changelog, recent updates and newly launced features.

Additionally, I've setup the updates routes (Get All and Get one) correctly to fetch updates only for a particular product, belonging to a particular user and not all updates on the db.
